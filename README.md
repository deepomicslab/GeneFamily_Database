# GeneFamily: A Comprehensive Mammalian Gene Family Database with Extensive Annotation and Interactive Visualization

## Abstract
Gene families underlie genetic innovation and phenotypic diversification. However, the identification, analysis, and interpretation of gene families depend on custom bioinformatics and visualization workflows that are mainly unattainable for non-expert users. To overcome the learning curve associated with analytical tools and the time costs involved in data collection and processing, we propose GeneFamily (https://gh.deepomics.org/), a comprehensive mammalian gene family database that incorporates extensive annotations and interactive visualizations. Leveraging whole-genome data from 138 mammalian species and Pfam-A Hidden Markov models, GeneFamily encompasses 2,036 gene families. Users can explore gene family distributions, phylogenetic trees, member diversities, sequence identities, structural features, conserved motifs, chromosomal localizations, neighboring regions, gene collinearities, duplication events, and adaptive signatures via an intuitive web interface. GeneFamily reduces technical barriers and accelerates research into gene family evolution, functional diversification, and comparative genomics across mammals.

## Environment
- Anaconda
- Python 3.9

## Dependencies
- pandas >= 2.0.3
- tqdm >= 4.66.5

## 1. IsoformFilter.py
### Description
IsoformFilter.py is used to filter protein isoforms to ensure that only one representative protein sequence is retained for each gene. During evolutionary analysis, a gene may produce multiple protein isoforms due to alternative splicing or post-translational modifications. These isoforms do not represent independent evolutionary units, so a representative sequence needs to be selected for analysis.

### Input Files
- Protein sequence files (.pep format) from Ensembl mammalian database
- Initial gene family search results: Feature1.all.txt

### Output Files
- Filtered results file: Feature.all.txt

### Processing Logic
- Group protein sequences by gene ID and species information
- Sort protein sequences within each group by length in descending order
- Select the longest protein sequence in each group as the gene representative
- Filter out remaining isoform sequences

## 2. Gene Family Member Counter
### Function Description
This module is used to count and organize gene family member information, classifying protein sequences that have been filtered by IsoformFilter.py into corresponding Gene Symbols (as gene members of the gene family), and establishing mapping relationships for gene family members.

### Input Files
- Gene family data file processed by IsoformFilter.py: Feature1.all.txt

### Output Files
```json
{
    "gene_family_name": ["member1", "member2", ...]
}
```

### Processing Logic
- Read filtered protein sequence data
- Match corresponding gene symbols for each sequence
- Mark sequences with missing gene symbols as "UNKNOWN"
- Remove duplicates from each gene family member list
- Generate mapping dictionary from gene family to member list

### Purpose
- Establish clear gene family member relationship diagrams
- Facilitate subsequent gene family analysis and evolutionary research
- Ensure uniqueness and traceability of each gene family member

## 3. GeneFamilyDiversityExtractor.py
### Function Description
